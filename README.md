ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Dunyu Liu, the computational geoscientist at Institute for Geophysics at the University of Texas at Austin. Welcome to my GitHub space, dedicated to reproducible, reliable, efficient and parallel open-source scientific software in geoscience and beyond.

A major line of my research is physics-based earthquake source, cycle, and ground motion modeling with parallel finite-element method, and their integration with various observations such as paleoseismic and ground motion data. 

Other research lines involve:
  * A toolset to constrain viscous anisotropy:
  * InSAR processing: 
  * Planetary modeling: 
  * Climate modeling:
 
Software development is driven by scientific questions.
