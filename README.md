ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Dunyu Liu, the computational geoscientist at Institute for Geophysics at the University of Texas at Austin. Welcome to my GitHub space, dedicated to user-friendly, reproducible, reliable, and parallel open-source scientific software in geoscience and beyond.

A major line of my research is physics-based earthquake source, cycle, and ground motion modeling with parallel finite-element method, and their integration with various observations such as paleoseismic and ground motion data. 

Applications and associated software include:
  * Scenario earthquakes with ground shaking with [__EQdyna__](https://github.com/EQDYNA/EQdyna.git) ([_Duan et al._, 2017, GRL](https://doi.org/10.1002/2017GL072638); [_Liu and Duan_, 2018, BSSA](https://doi.org/10.1785/0120170374)).
  * Multicycle earthquake dynamics integrated with paleoseismic data with [__EQdyna.2Dcycle__](https://github.com/EQDYNA/EQdyna.2Dcycle.git) for San Andreas Fault [(_Liu et al._, 2022, JGR)](https://doi.org/10.1029/2021JB023420), and for Altyn Tagh Fault [(_Liu et al._, 2021, Tectonophysics)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tecto.2021.228948)
  * Rate- and state-friction-based earthquake cycles. Refs for 3-D fault with a kink using [__EQQuasi__](https://github.com/EQDYNA/EQquasi.git) [(_Liu et al._, 2020, GJI)](https://doi.org/10.1093/gji/ggz475), and for geometrically complex faults with [__EQdyna__](https://github.com/EQDYNA/EQdyna.git) and dynamic relaxation [(_Luo et al._, 2020, BSSA)](https://doi.org/10.1785/0120200047).
  * Ground shaking over cycles with [__EQsimu__](https://github.com/EQDYNA/EQsimu.git), a computing infrastructure for coupling of sophisticated physics-based modeling modules in earthquake research. Latest SCEC report is [here](https://files.scec.org/s3fs-public/reports/2022/22035_report.pdf?Uy_apeoFDp52QDVw8tJRoMVBzZwSNh4C).  
  * Community benchmarks for [__EQdyna__](https://github.com/EQDYNA/EQdyna.git) [(_Harris et al._, 2018, BSSA)](https://doi.org/10.1785/0220170222), and for [__EQQuasi__](https://github.com/EQDYNA/EQquasi.git) [(_Jiang et al._, 2022, JGR)](https://doi.org/10.1029/2021JB023519)

  * Interferometic Synthetic Aperture Radar(InSAR):
    * Development of [__GMTSAR__](https://github.com/gmtsar/gmtsar). Latest NSF CSSI poster is [here](https://figshare.com/articles/poster/Monitoring_earth_surface_deformation_with_the_next_generation_of_InSAR_satellites_GMTSAR/26767699/1?file=48629041). 
    * InSAR + physics_based modeling integration [(_Xu et al._, 2023, GRL)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2022GL101692)
  * Planetary modeling: 
  * Climate modeling:

 
Philosophy of software development:
  * Software development should be driven by scientific questions.
  * A clean code passes all the tests, removes duplications, and requires constant refactoring.
  * The primary user of your code is very likely yourself. Therefore, write a clean code to free yourself from debugging.
