- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Dunyu Liu.
- ðŸ‘€ I work on integrating earthquake modeling with observations to understand the complexity behind earthquakes. Primarily I work with high-performance computing and I develop numerical tools, which you can find in my repos. Currently, I work on earthquake ground motion, mechanical viscous anisotropy, climate modeling, and Mercury interior.
