ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Dunyu Liu, the computational geoscientist at Institute for Geophysics at the University of Texas at Austin. Welcome to my GitHub space, dedicated to reproducible, reliable, efficient and parallel open-source scientific software in geoscience and beyond.

A major line of my research is physics-based earthquake source, cycle, and ground motion modeling with parallel finite-element method, and their integration with various observations such as paleoseismic and ground motion data. 

Applications and associated software include:
  * Scenario earthquakes with ground shaking with [__EQdyna__](https://github.com/EQDYNA/EQdyna.git) ([_Duan et al._, 2017, GRL](https://doi.org/10.1002/2017GL072638); [_Liu and Duan_, 2018, BSSA](https://doi.org/10.1785/0120170374)).
  * Multicycle earthquake dynamics integrated with paleoseismic data with [__EQdyna.2Dcycle__](https://github.com/EQDYNA/EQdyna.2Dcycle.git) for San Andreas Fault [(_Liu et al._, 2022, JGR)](https://doi.org/10.1029/2021JB023420), and for Altyn Tagh Fault [(_Liu et al._, 2021, Tectonophysics)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tecto.2021.228948)
  * Rate- and state-friction-based earthquake cycles. Refs for 3-D fault with a kink using [__EQQuasi__](https://github.com/EQDYNA/EQquasi.git) [(_Liu et al._, 2020, GJI)](https://doi.org/10.1093/gji/ggz475), and for geometrically complex faults with [__EQdyna__](https://github.com/EQDYNA/EQdyna.git) and dynamic relaxation [(_Luo et al._, 2020, BSSA)](https://doi.org/10.1785/0120200047).   
  * Community benchmarks for [__EQdyna__](https://github.com/EQDYNA/EQdyna.git) [(_Harris et al._, 2018, BSSA)](https://doi.org/10.1785/0220170222), and for [__EQQuasi__](https://github.com/EQDYNA/EQquasi.git) [(_Jiang et al._, 2022, JGR)](https://doi.org/10.1029/2021JB023519) 

Other research lines involve:
  * Geodynamics:
    * A toolset to constrain viscous anisotropy [(_Liu et al._, 2024, GJI)](https://doi.org/10.1093/gji/ggae296)
    * Forward/Inverse framework [(_Puel et al._, 2022, GJI)](https://doi.org/10.1093/gji/ggac050), [(_Puel et al._, 2024, Sci Adv)](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/sciadv.adl4264)
  * InSAR processing software development with [__GMTSAR__](https://github.com/gmtsar/gmtsar); InSAR + physics_based modeling integration [(_Xu et al._, 2023, GRL)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2022GL101692)
  * Planetary modeling: 
  * Climate modeling:

 
Philosophy of software development:
  * Software development should be driven by scientific questions.
  * A clean code passes all the tests, removes duplications, and require constant refactoring.
  * The primary user of your code is likely yourself. Therefore, write a clean code to free yourself from debugging.
